## Problem Statement

Department of Parks and Recreation of San Francisco decided to have a film-lover festival hosted. They hired you to architect a system that would support the website for the festival. You need to dig through some datasets they have assembled over the years that include info about the parks they oversee. You also have received some privately owned park information that is open to the public, the department wants to collaborate with those private entities in hosting the festival. You will also have to ingest data from private sources along with the provided public data. The festival organization committee would also like to track if there was a movie filmed at any of the parks / locations they oversee to host special movie showings and tours. Don’t forget there are ratings attached to each of the parks that they have been tracking over the years.

Few things to create track of before diving into design:

Look through the data and make notes of which datasets and which columns could be useful for the department of parks and recreation’s film-lover festival database.
After you have identified those above, clean, trim, and adjust the data as needed.
Set up the database and populate it with the clean data.
